# Assignment for TU -- XML parsing

Scripts for parsing XML files for specific values. Available in two flavors, Node.js and sh script.

# Usage (sh script)

The shell script depends on libxml for the xmllint command. Run with `./parse-xml.sh file.xml`.

# Usage (Node.js script)

The Node.js script requires Node.js and npm (node package manager) installed on your system. Once you have those installed, run `npm install` inside the directory to install the xml2js dependency. You can then run the script with `./parse-xml.js file.xml`.
